### The Origin: *From Musical Passion to Scientific Insight*

Since the age of 16, music has been more than a hobby — it has been a constant driving force in my life. Drumming and singing as a self-taught musician across stages in Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, and New Zealand, I have lived music not as a full-time professional, but as a dedicated performer. My journey through music — ranging from Spotify releases and YouTube videos to diverse band experiences and live performances — has profoundly shaped my understanding of musicians' physical and emotional landscapes.

My professional exposure to the music industry — working in international music marketing at Believe Digital and in professional recording studios like klangBezirk
— opened my eyes to the often-hidden challenges musicians face. Behind the glamour, I witnessed the physical and mental strain that comes with creating art.

A pivotal moment came during an intense recording session when I first experienced the warning signs of physical strain, making it difficult to perform at my usual level. This was not just a personal experience, but a broader narrative I saw repeated among musicians around me, highlighting the universal struggles musicians face with their physical well-being.

My scientific background transformed these observations into a mission. With a Bachelor's and Master's in Psychological Science, specialising in performance 
science and motor rehabilitation research, I saw an opportunity to bridge my musical insight with rigorous scientific methodology.
