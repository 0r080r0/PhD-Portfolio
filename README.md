# The Origin: From *Musical Passion* to *Scientific Insight*

# ADD WEBSITE LINK

Since the age of 16, music has been more than a hobby — it has been my lifeline. Drumming and singing across stages in Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, and 
New Zealand, I have lived music not as a full-time professional, but as a dedicated, high-level performer. Music releases on Spotify, YouTube videos, 
multiple diverse band experiences, and live concerts have shaped my deep understanding of musicians' physical and emotional landscapes.

My professional exposure to the music industry — working in international music marketing at Believe Digital and in professional recording studios like klangBezirk
— opened my eyes to the often-hidden challenges musicians face. Behind the glamour, I witnessed the physical and mental strain that comes with creating art.

A pivotal moment came during an intense recording session. As a singer, I felt the first warning sign of vocal strain, which made it hard to hit the high notes. 
This was not just a personal experience, but a broader narrative I saw repeated among musicians around me.

My scientific background transformed these observations into a mission. With a Bachelor's and Master's in Psychological Science, specialising in performance 
science and motor rehabilitation research, I saw an opportunity to bridge my musical insight with rigorous scientific methodology.
